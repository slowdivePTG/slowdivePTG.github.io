I am always fascinated by anything that allows me to <i>speak to myself</i> - all those *pure* and *interesting* issues including **photography**, **classic & rock music** and **literature**. My new (non-academic and capricious) writings are posted below, including but not limited to travel journals and surrealistic thoughts.

### On The Road

### AGN Induced X-ray Chemistry
#### Advisor: Xian Chen

- Supermassive black holes are widely held in galaxies. To reach their current masses they must have experienced episodic accretion, that is AGN phases.
- In the case of our Milky Way Galaxy, we are surprised to find that the supermassive black hole in the galactic center underwent an AGN phase about only 6 million years ago, during which the energetic electromagnetic radiation would significantly promote the ionization rate in the molecular clouds, leading to the synthesis of more complex species and even prebiotic organic compounds.
- ***Just passed the midterm examination of the Undergraduate Research and Training Program and will be funded National Innovation Training Program.***



### A Systematic Search For Periodic White Dwarfs Using ZTF Data
#### Advisor: Shrinivas R. Kulkarni

- The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a new optical time-domain survey that uses the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt telescope equipped with a 47-square-degree CCD camera.

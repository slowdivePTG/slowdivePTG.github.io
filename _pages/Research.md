### AGN Induced X-ray Chemistry
#### Advisor: Xian Chen

- Supermassive black holes are widely held in galaxies. To reach their current masses they must have experienced episodic accretion, that is AGN phases.
- In the case of our Milky Way Galaxy, we are surprise to find that the supermassive black hole in the galactic center underwent an AGN phase about only 6 million years ago, during which the energetic electromagnetic radiation would significantly promote the ionization rate in the molecular clouds, leading to the synthesis of more complex species and even prebiotic organic compounds.
- ***Just passed the midterm examination of the Undergraduate Research and Training Program.***

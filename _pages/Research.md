### AGN Induced X-ray Chemistry

***Advisor: [Xian Chen](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/people/xian-chen-陈弦)***
- Part of *the Undergraduate Research & Training Program* in PKU, and funded by *the National Innovation Training Program*.
- The supermassive black hole (SMBH) in our galaxy which is currently quiescent must have undergone active galactic nuclei (AGN) phases.
- Recent observations show evidence for an AGN event 2-8 Myr ago in the Milky Way, of which the hard X-ray radiation could efficiently penetrate the dense, dusty galactic disk and can lead to the synthesis of complex species related to the origin of life.
- Simulation on a gaseous model is conducted based on dense molecular cloud including X-ray ionization and simple surface processes, testing whether several typical prebiotic species show observable changes in abundance with a former AGN. The influence of the galactic location and column density of the molecular gas are also discussed.

### Search For Periodic White Dwarfs Using ZTF Data

***Advisor: [Shrinivas R. Kulkarni](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~srk/)***
- Under the framework of *Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)* in Caltech.
- The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a state-of-the-art optical time-domain survey that uses the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt telescope equipped with a 47-square-degree CCD camera.
- A sample of 81 periodic white dwarfs (WDs) with periods between 1 and 3 hr is selected from a population of 486,641 WDs in the second data release of the Gaia mission, by applying Lomb-Scargle periodogram to light curves obtained with ZTF.
- Several sources of interest (eclipsing, reflection, accreting and contact binaries) are identified through a combined analysis of both light curves (ZTF) and colors (Gaia, PanSTARRS).

### Mass Transfer Hydrodynamics In Compact Binaries

***Advisor: [Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz](http://www.ucolick.org/~enrico/home.html)***
- Undergraduate thesis.

## AGN Induced X-ray Chemistry

***Advisor: [Xian Chen](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/people/xian-chen-陈弦)***

- Part of *the Undergraduate Research & Training Program* at PKU, and funded by *the National Innovation Training Program*.
- First-authored paper, [Impact of an Active Sgr A* on the Synthesis of Water and Organic Molecules Throughout the Milky Way](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aba758), has been published on ApJ.
- The supermassive black hole (SMBH) in our galaxy which is currently quiescent must have undergone active galactic nuclei (AGN) phases. But recent observations show evidence for an AGN event 2-8 Myr ago in the Milky Way, of which the hard X-ray radiation could efficiently penetrate the dense, dusty galactic disk and can lead to the synthesis of complex species related to the origin of life.
- We conduct astrochemical simulations on a gas-phase model based on dense molecular cloud, with X-ray ionization and important surface processes carefully attached, to test whether several typical prebiotic species show observable changes in abundance with a former AGN.
- We find that X-ray irradiation could significantly enhance the abundances of these species. The effect is most significant in young, high-density molecular clouds and could be prominent at a Galactic distance of 8 kpc or smaller. The imprint in the chemical abundance is visible even several million years after the AGN turns off.

## Search For Periodic White Dwarfs With ZTF

***Advisor: [Shrinivas R. Kulkarni](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~srk/)***

- Under the framework of *Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)* at Caltech.
- The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a state-of-the-art optical time-domain survey that uses the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt telescope equipped with a 47-square-degree CCD camera.
- A sample of 81 periodic white dwarfs (WDs) with periods between 1 and 3 hr is selected from a population of 486,641 WDs in the second data release of the Gaia mission, by applying Lomb-Scargle periodogram to light curves obtained with ZTF.
- Several sources of interest (eclipsing, reflection, accreting and contact binaries) are identified through a combined analysis of both light curves (ZTF) and colors (Gaia, PanSTARRS).

## Mass Transfer In Compact Binaries

***Advisor: [Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz](http://www.ucolick.org/~enrico/home.html)***

- Undergraduate thesis during the visit to UCSC.
- Ultra-compact white dwarf binary (white dwarf binaries with period lower than 1 hr) are bright GW sources in the sky and are possible SN Ia progenitors.
- The fate of such a binary depends on the angular momentum evolution. For direct impact systems, of which the mass transfer flow hits directly the accretor, the angular momentum transition cannot be analytically calculated.
- Hydrodynamical simulation is conducted to study the destiny of direct impact systems in certain parameter spaces.

            where I work with Prof. Adam Miller to unravel the mysteries of the transient universe with data science.
            My thesis focuses on the demographics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia),
            the cosmic candles that illuminate our understanding of dark energy.

            My research leverages advanced statistical and data science methodologies to analyze
            vast datasets from time-domain surveys alongside observations from world-class telescopes,
            uncovering subtle patterns and correlations that reveal the underlying physics driving these events.
            With a primary focus on transient phenomena,
            my research spans theory, observation, machine learning, and software.

        <p>
            My journey began in <b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinchang_County'>Xinchang (新昌)</a></b>,
            a serene mountainous county in China,
            where I spent countless hours wandering ancient paths that once inspired classical poets.
            It was there, beneath star-filled skies, that I first experienced the profound wonder of the cosmos,
            long before I encountered my first physics equation.
            As a <a href="https://ptgcliu.myportfolio.com"><b>photographer</b></a>, I carry forward that same wonder that first drew me to the stars.

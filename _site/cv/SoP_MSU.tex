\lettersection{Why MSU? - Academic Interests}

Closely cooperating with experimental \& theoretical physicists, astronomy research at MSU is well-known for cutting edge study on high energy astrophysical events. Members of the stellar \& nuclear group with strong computational background use state-of-the-art codes including \texttt{Enzo} and \texttt{FLASH} to construct epic models for compact binaries, core-collapse supernovae, and accreting processes. Graduate students will receive training in observation in world-class facilities including SOAR as well as training in computational skills as part of the optional graduate courses. They would have access to world-leading supercomputers, such as Blue Waters. MSU also encourages graduate students to start research early in their first year and pairs beginning graduate students with senior graduate mentors and senior graduate as part of the mentoring program, which will definitely help me get started and hone my academic abilities.

I am not too surprised to find that MSU meets so perfectly with my research experience and interests. \textbf{Prof. Stephen Zepf} has performed observational work on multiwavelength properties for X-ray sources in globular clusters with SOAR, HST, and Chandra. \textbf{Prof. Jay Strader} also has great contribution in searching for black holes in globular clusters, and is highly involved in time domain surveys such as ASSAS-SN. I also appreciate \textbf{Prof. Laura Chomiuk}’s multiwavelength work, from radio to gamma-ray band, on interacting compact binaries to study their evolution as Type Ia supernovae progenitor. My experience in the summer with high energy transients and data analysis in time-domain surveys surely enables me to conduct further research on these compact objects. And again, out of an intense interest to combine observation with computational methods, I do admire \textbf{Prof. Sean Couch}’s simulation work on core-collapse supernovae with \texttt{FLASH}, for which I have plenty of coding experience.


I do appreciate it if you could consider my application. I am looking forward to meeting with you for a more detailed talk soon.

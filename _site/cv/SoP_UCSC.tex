\lettersection{Why UCSC? - Academic Interests and Plans}
%------------------------------------------------
With unparalleled observational resources, UCSC is one of the world’s centers for astronomy. Working at UCSC as a visitor for months, I am also deeply impressed by the power of computational methods in understanding extreme astrophysical environments. UCSC highly emphasized academic training and independent research for graduate students. I would have access to diversified cutting-edge astrophysics knowledge in taking the courses as well as attending lunch talks, FLASH talks, colloquiums, and conferences. As a member of a spontaneously organized journal club of astrophysics within us undergraduate students, I deeply understand how the journal clubs on recent arXiv papers at UCSC can hone my academic presentation skills.

The 2020s' will witness the rise of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, especially after the first light of LSST and the launch of LISA. My experiences in observing the time-domain sky and modeling the evolution of compact binaries help to build my intense interest in the most energetic, ``breath-taking'’ events. I plan to perform my future research on various high-energy transients such as compact binaries and supernovae. I am not too surprised to find that UCSC meets so perfectly with my research experience. It would be great if I can continue working with Prof. Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, whose excellent research covers a great breadth of computational astrophysics, including compact binary evolution, GRB triggers, and tidal events around black holes. Under his supervision, revealing the nature of compact objects with sophisticated observational properties through simulations is bound to be an exciting journey. Prof. Ryan Foley is one of the greatest supernovae hunters. I am particularly interested in electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources, of which he has rich observational experience. Besides, I also appreciate Prof. Brant Robertson’s leading work in the Computational Astrophysics Research Group, aiming at understanding the large scale structure, reionization, and intergalactic medium through advanced numerical methodologies.

I do appreciate it if you could consider my application. I am looking forward to meeting with you for a more detailed talk soon.

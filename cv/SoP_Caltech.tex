\lettersection{Why Caltech? - Academic Interests}
With unparalleled observational resources, Caltech is one of the world’s centers for astronomy. As a SURF student last summer, I was deeply impressed by the power of ZTF in understanding the nature of transients. I have also witnessed how transient hunters are able to extract photometric and spectroscopic information for sources of interest and turn it into astonishing astrophysical outputs, with a sufficient amount of observation time for world-class observatories such as Keck, Palomar, etc. For graduate students at Caltech, both academic training and independent research are highly emphasized. I would have access to diversified cutting-edge astrophysics knowledge in taking the courses as well as attending seminars and conferences. As a member of a spontaneously organized journal club of astrophysics within us undergraduate students, I deeply understand how Caltech's Journal Club seminar can hone my academic presentation skills.

I am not too surprised to find that Caltech meets so perfectly with my research experience. It will be great if I can continue to work with \textbf{Prof. Shri Kulkarni}, whose research interests and achievement cover considerably subfields. I do admire his recent work on instrumentation and physics on the transient sky, and I am keen on searching for compact objects, such as the quiescent black holes hidden in detached binaries, for a statistical study of stellar evolution. I also appreciate \textbf{Prof. Mansi Kasliwal}’s work with Palomar Gattini-IR, a survey searching for variable stars, counterparts to GW events, stellar mergers and even microlensing in infrared band. And again, out of an intense interest to combine observation with computational methods, I admire \textbf{Prof. Jim Fuller}’s theoretical work on gravity waves in a variety of objects, elaborated in his excellent talk at the Institute for Advanced Study on Dec 10. I am especially interested in the potential of wave-driven physics in understanding different types of supernovae and fast optical transients with the help of the stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA}. \textbf{Prof. Phil Hopkins}’ work on hydrodynamics in cosmological simulation with the FIRE project is also fascinating, for which my experience in hydrodynamical simulations will be of use.


I do appreciate it if you could consider my application. I am looking forward to meeting with you for a more detailed talk soon.

{A Systematic Search For Periodic White Dwarfs Using ZTF Data} % Job title
{Astronomy Department, Caltech} % Organization
{Pasadena, US} % Location
{Jun 2019 - Aug 2019} % Date(s)
{Mentor: Shrinivas R. Kulkarni}
{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
	\begin{cvitems}
		\item {\textit{Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)}}
		\item {Explored the potential of the state-of-the-art time-domain facility - Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) by conducting a systematic search for periodic white dwarfs with periods lying within 1-3 hr.}
		\item {A cross match between \textit{Gaia} and ZTF was performed, selecting $\sim$ 90,000 \textit{Gaia} sources with enough ZTF data.}
		\item {A number of 81 sources stood out as periodic under the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram. }
		\item {A analysis in the shapes of light curves derived from ZTF as well as color analysis with \textit{Gaia} and PanSTARRS data led to discovery of eclipsing systems, reflection systems, cataclysmic variables and other sources of interest.}

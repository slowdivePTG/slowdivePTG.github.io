{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
\begin{cvitems}
\item {\textit{Undergraduate Research \& Training Program - National Innovation Training Program}}
\item {Worked on the chemical impacts of an AGN, especially the impact on the synthesis of prebiotic organic molecules, to indicate the potential correlation between the activity of a supermassive black hole and both the origin and the evolution of life.}
\item {Calculated the ionization rates of electromagnetic radiation caused by accretion the supermassive black hole in the Milky Way, in different galactic distance from the black hole.}
\item {Completed the codes for photo-ionization processes of various atoms and molecules based on the widely used package in astrochemistry - KROME.}

{A Systematic Search For Periodic White Dwarfs Using ZTF Data} % Job title
{Astronomy Department, Caltech} % Organization
{Pasadena, US} % Location
{Jun. 2019 - Aug. 2019} % Date(s)
{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
	\begin{cvitems}
		\item {\textit{Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)}}
		\item {Explored the potential of the state-of-the-art time-domain facility - Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) by conducting a systematic search for periodic white dwarfs with periods lying within 1-3 hr.}
		\item {A cross match between \textit{Gaia} and ZTF was performed, selecting $\sim$ 90,000 \textit{Gaia} sources with enough ZTF data.}
		\item {A number of 81 sources stood out as periodic under the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram. }
		\item {A analysis in the shapes of light curves derived from ZTF as well as color analysis with \textit{Gaia} and PanSTARRS data led to discovery of eclipsing systems, reflection systems, cataclysmic variables and other sources of interest.}

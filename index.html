          I am <b>Chang Liu (刘畅)</b>. I just received my Bachelor of Science (Hon) at <b><a href = 'https://astro.pku.edu.cn'><font color="#8c0000">Department of Astronomy, Peking University</font></a></b>. Now I am in my gap year working as a research assistant at <b><a href = 'http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn'>Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA), Peking University</a></b>. On 2021, I will join Department of <b><a href = 'https://physics.northwestern.edu'><font color='4E2A84'>Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University</font></a></b> as a graduate student.

          One of my greatest pursuits is to combine state-of-the-art observations with powerful computational methods to understand complex transient universe. This sweet 'temptation' has driven me to explore observational and computational astrophysics from astrochemistry within interstellar medium to binary systems in a large variety of scales, from ultra-compact double white dwarfs to stars orbiting around supermassive black holes. Some of my past researches are listed in <b><a href="/Science">Science</a></b>.

       <ul>
          I was born in <b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinchang_County'>Xinchang (新昌)</a></b>, China, a mountainous, peaceful county where I used to wander as all those Chinese ancient poets did, counting stars and daydreaming, and was then fascinated by the nature for the first time, long before I picked up physics. I have inevitably become a shutterbug (my <u><a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/slowdiveptg/'>Instagram</a></u>) and kept reading, wandering, and writing as my hobbies.

            My research leverages advanced data science methodologies to analyze vast datasets from
            time-domain surveys (ZTF, and the upcoming LS4 and LSST) alongside observations from world-class telescopes
            including Keck, MMT, and Magellan. My thesis will focus on the demographics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia),
            the
            cosmic candles that
            illuminate our understanding of the dark energy, whose progenitor systems remain a major unknown in
            astrophysics.

            My research vision is to decode the population-level origins of cosmic transients using large,
            well-monitored samples with complete temporal coverage, from days after explosion to years-long evolution that follows. I apply advanced statistical techniques to mine these extensive
            datasets, uncovering subtle patterns and correlations that expose the underlying physical processes driving
            these events. Our work has already illuminated the explosion mechanisms of some of the most peculiar SNe Ia, and is
            paving the way toward a deeper, population-wide understanding of how these stellar explosions arise.

            With the primary focus on transient phenomena, my research spans theory, observation, machine
            learning, and software.
            I have simulated stars repeatedly torn
            apart by supermassive black holes, built a machine-learning star-galaxy classifier that drives real-time
            transient searches in the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4), and developed a new spectroscopic
            technique for precision galaxy background subtraction, enabling far cleaner measurements of transient light.

        <p>
            My journey began in <b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinchang_County'>Xinchang (新昌)</a></b>, a
            serene mountainous county in China, where I spent countless hours wandering ancient paths that once inspired
            classical poets. It was there, beneath star-filled skies, that I first experienced the profound wonder of
            the cosmos, long before I encountered my first physics equation. Those early moments of stargazing and
            contemplation ignited a lifelong passion for understanding our place in the universe.

           I am <b>Chang Liu (刘畅)</b>, currently a research assistant at <u><a href = 'http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn'>Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University</a></u>. I received my Bachelor of Science (Hon) at Department of Astronomy, Peking University. One of my greatest pursuits is to combine state-of-the-art observations with powerful computational methods to understand complex astrophysical environments. This sweet `temptation' has driven me to explore observational and computational astrophysics from astrochemistry within interstellar medium to various binary systems.

           I was born in Xinchang (新昌), a mountainous, peaceful county where I used to wander as all those Chinese ancient poets did, counting stars and daydreaming, and was fascinated by the nature for the first time. That is why in addition to a student in astronomy, I have become a shutterbug (my <u><a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/slowdiveptg/'>Instagram</a></u>).
